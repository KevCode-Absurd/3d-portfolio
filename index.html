      <h3>Design of Polyphase FilterBank for 2048 Channel Digital Spectrometer</h3>
      <p>
        PFB comprises of commutator ,FFT and filter banks. Commutator converts radio signals into digital signals. It
        reduces power
        consumption, hardware utilization and the silicon size chip. Filterbanks suppresses sidelobes of bin frequencies
        and reduces the
        scalloping loss. FFT follows follows divide and conquer rule algorithm and reduces spectral leakage and avoids
        aliasing. PFB produces
        flat response across the radio wave channel and controls the frequency response of each channel.

      <h2>üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL SKILLS</h2>

      <h3>Language: Python</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>FUN FACT:</strong> Python is used by Intel, IBM, NASA, Pixar, JP Morgan Chase, and a number of other
        major companies. It is one of the four main languages at Google (along with C++, Java, and Go). Google's YouTube
        is largely written in Python.
      </p><br>

      <h3>Cloud: AWS</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>FUN FACT:</strong> AWS was launched from the existing Amazon framework. It was designed to take care of
        the online retail transactions. Amazon was one of the first corporations to offer a pay-as-you-go cloud
        computing model that adapts to give users computing and digital storage resources as they need it.
      </p><br>

      <h3>Operating System: Windows, Linux.</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>FUN FACT:</strong> While Bill Gates is a genius when it comes to software development his marketing
        skills aren‚Äôt on par with his coding prowess. Back when the first version of Windows was in works one of the
        founders of Microsoft had an idea regarding the mane of the upcoming operating system.<br><br>
        Bill Gates wanted to call the OS ‚ÄúInterface Manager‚Äù and for a while that was the official name for the
        operating system. But then people from the marketing department heard about it and strongly suggested to Gates
        that Windows sounds much better. And he agreed.
